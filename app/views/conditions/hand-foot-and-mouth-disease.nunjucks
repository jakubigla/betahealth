  <h2>How to treat hand, foot and mouth disease at home</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>drink fluids to avoid dehydration (avoid acidic drinks, like fruit juice)</li>
    <li>eat soft foods like soup</li>
    <li>take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help ease a sore throat and bring
      down a temperature</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can buy mouth ulcer gels, sprays, and mouthwashes to ease the
    blisters. Always check they are suitable for children and give the
    correct dose.</p>

  <div class="callout callout__info">
    <h2>See a GP if</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>your child isn’t better after a week</li>
      <li>your child is dehydrated &mdash; they’re not weeing as often as usual</li>
      <li>you’re concerned about your child’s symptoms</li>
      <li>you’re pregnant and get hand, foot and mouth disease</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>How to stop hand, foot and mouth disease spreading</h2>

  <p>Hand, foot and mouth disease spreads easily.</p>

  <p>Keep your child away from school or nursery while they're feeling
    unwell. Generally, there's no need to keep them off until the blisters
    scab. However, check with your school or nursery as they may have their
    own guidance.</p>

  <h2>Hand, foot and mouth disease in pregnancy</h2>

  <p>It’s best to avoid close contact with anyone who has hand, foot and
    mouth disease.</p>

  <p>There’s normally no risk to the pregnancy or baby. However, there’s
    limited evidence that in very rare cases catching it during the first
    3 months of pregnancy could lead to miscarriage. This risk is very
    low.</p>
